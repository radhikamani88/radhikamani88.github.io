We <b>did the following steps in the 6 sprints</b> and each week we would produce a report documenting our progress, findings and results in that sprint.

After each game, team members provided feedback, listing one thing they enjoyed and one thing they wanted improved.

                                                In these games, players usually die midway game due to no fault of theirs. This reduced game engagement. Players don't die in Latitude 90 however and hence we found it to be superior in that respect.

                                                As there was no computer involved in these games, it was very hard for players to find any conclusive evidence to make progress in finding who the adversary was. This usually led to dissapointment as players were killed incorrectly and forced to sit out the rest of the game.

                        As none of us were experts in social deduction games, we decided to conduct ethnographic studies to study the behavior of players when they are playing this game. This was viable since we were in an university and it was easy to find participants who were interested in social deduction games and had played such games before.

                        4 of 5 total sessions were with the same two playtest groups. It was this iterative user feedback that powered our Agile process. We collected <b>100+ responses and 10+ hours of footage</b>. Playtesting was ideal as it let us both observe users naturally and receive direct feedback afterwards. During each game, the team recorded notable interactions in-game (positive and negative). After each game, we conducted moderated sessions where each participant provided feedback. We had the following <b>findings</b>:
